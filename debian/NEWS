asterisk (1:20.0.1~dfsg+~cs6.12.40431414-1) unstable; urgency=high

  Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) now restricts access
  for functions GetConfig and UpdateConfig.
  New option "live_dangerously" relaxes that restriction.

asterisk (1:18.11.1~dfsg+~cs6.10.40431413-1) unstable; urgency=medium

asterisk (1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Asterisk now include all voicemail modules, under different names.
  If you previously used either of the packages
  asterisk-voicemail-imapstorage or asterisk-voicemail-odbcstorage
  then make sure to change configuration to now instead enable
  module app_voicemail_imap or app_voicemail_odbc, correspondingly.

asterisk (1:16.16.1~dfsg+~2.10-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Asterisk modules are now stored in multiarch-compatible paths.

  If you use only Debian-provided Asterisk packages, including the
  asterisk-config package, just make sure to accept package changes if
  asked during package upgrade.
  Otherwise make sure setting "astmoddir" in /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf
  matches the location of installed modules
  (e.g. "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/asterisk/modules" on amd64 systems),
  and rebuild/move custom-built modules to use same location.

asterisk (1:11.6.0~dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  The cdr_radius.so and cel_radius.so modules are now linked against
  libfreeradius-client2 instead of libradiusclient-ng2 so the default RADIUS
  configuration file has changed to /etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf.

  If you use a custom RADIUS configuration file, please update it so that it
  is compatible with libfreeradius-client2 by adding:

  radius_deadtime 0

  If you do not take this step you are likely to encounter a SEGFAULT when
  asterisk starts up.

asterisk (1:11.6.0~dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  A number of Asterisk modules have been moved to their own packages:
  * asterisk-dahdi: chan_dahdi and other modules that depend on DAHDI.
  * asterisk-vpb: chan_vpb.

  If you have DAHDI devices or VoiceTronix devices that use chan_vpb, you
  need one of those two respective packagees installed.

  The fix for AST-2009-006 breaks IAX2 line protocol by adding an extra
  step in the IAX2 handshaking. To allow working with unmodified IAX2
  implementations, add the following two lines under [general] in iax.conf:
 
  calltokenoptional = 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
  maxcallnumbers = 16382

asterisk (1:1.4.13~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since this version, ODBC and IMAP storage for Voicemail are provided.
  As this could not be done as a runtime option, app_voicemail_odbc.so and
  app_voicemail_imap.so are provided. However, these conflict app_voicemail.so
  and each other.
  If you use a modified modules.conf and you have autoload enabled, you *must*
  add explicit noload entries for two of the three voicemail modules.

  The iLBC codec library code has been removed from the Debian asterisk
  package as it does not conform with the DFSG.

asterisk (1:1.0.7.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The Debian version of the upstream asterisk source has had the fpm Music on Hold
  removed as this music has only been licenced for use within asterisk which is
  incompatible with the Debian Free Software Guildlines 
  <http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines>. Please drop your alternative
  Music on Hold into the directory /usr/share/asterisk/mohmp3/
