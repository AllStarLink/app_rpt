Comment:
 File lacks copyright and licensing,
 but contains the comment
 "Conversion routines derived from code by guido@sienanet.it"
 which might be interpreted as
 a copyright holder not granting a license.
 More likely, however,
 the header file is considered non-copyrightable header
 with merely a remark about origin of inspiration:
 .
   * File was introduced in Asterisk 0.1.1
     (according to git sources),
     together with file format_wav_gsm.c containing same comment
     but also explicit copyright and licensing:
     <https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/0ed94773>.
 .
   * Asterisk 0.1.1 was released in 1999
     (according to git sources),
     at about which time Guido Giorgetti <guido@sienanet.it>
     released audio-related Delphi 3 code as "Freeware":
     <http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/authors/a0002451.htm>
     <http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/ftp/d30free/tmsgvoc.zip>

 Thank you for your trouble.
 I intended the software to be free.
 GPL is fine.

 and is also available under alternative licenses
 negotiated directly with Digium, Inc.
 If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL,
 then the GPL applies to all loadable Asterisk modules
 used on your system as well,
 except as defined below.
 The GPL (version 2) is included in this source tree
 in the file <COPYING>.
 .
 This package also includes various components
 that are not part of Asterisk itself;
 these components are in the 'contrib' directory
 and its subdirectories.
 These components are also distributed
 under the GPL version 2 as well.
 .
 Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services)
 holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses
 to all components of the Asterisk package,
 and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
 for companies, individuals, or organizations
 to create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules
 which may be dynamically linked at runtime
 with the portions of Asterisk which fall
 under our copyright/license umbrella,
 or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.
 .
 If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs,
 don't worry -- there is no requirement
 that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products
 (although if you've written a module for Asterisk
 we would strongly encourage you
 to make the same exception that we do).
 .
 Specific permission is also granted
 to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323
 and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit
 and distribute the resulting binary files.
 .
 In addition,
 Asterisk implements two management/control protocols:
 the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)
 and the Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI).
 It is our belief that applications using these protocols
 to manage or control an Asterisk instance
 do not have to be licensed
 under the GPL or a compatible license,
 as we believe these protocols do not create a 'derivative work'
 as referred to in the GPL.
 However, should any court or other judiciary body find
 that these protocols do fall under the terms of the GPL,
 then we hereby grant you a license
 to use these protocols in combination
 with Asterisk in external applications
 licensed under any license you wish.
 .
 The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks
 owned by Digium, Inc.,
 and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies.
 If you wish to use these trademarks
 for purposes other than simple redistribution
 of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium,
 you should contact our licensing department
 to determine the necessary steps you must take.
