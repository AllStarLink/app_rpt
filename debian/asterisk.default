# This file allows you to alter the configuration of the Asterisk
# init.d script. Normally you should leave the file as-is.
#
# RUNASTERISK: If set to anything other that 'yes', the asterisk init.d script
#              will not run. The default is 'yes'.
#RUNASTERISK=no
#
#
# AST_REALTIME: if set to anything other than "no", asterisk will run in 
#               real-time priority (pass '-p' to asterisk). un-rem the 
#               following line to disable asterisk from running in real-time 
#               priority. The default is 'yes'.
#AST_REALTIME=no
#
# PARAMS: extra parameters to pass to asterisk: generate cores in 
#         case of crash, and be more verbose. -F guarantees that Asterisk 
#         will still run daemonized.
#
#         Instead of adding switches here, consider editing 
#         /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf
#PARAMS="-F -g -vvv"
#
#
# RUNASTSAFE: run safe_asterisk rather than asterisk (will auto-restart upon
#             crash). This is generally less tested and has some known issues
#             with properly starting and stopping Asterisk.
#RUNASTSAFE=yes
#
# MAXFILES: Set this to the number of open file handles the Asterisk 
#           process can have. Useful if you get "Too many open files" error.
#MAXFILES=8192
#
# AST_DUMPCORE: if set to anything other than "no", asterisk will be run with
#               the option -g (to tell it to dump core on crash) and its
#               working directory will be set to /var/spool/asterisk, as that
#               directory is writable and hence core files can be written there.
#               See /etc/init.d/asterisk for some other relevant variables.
#
#               It is recommended that you install asterisk-dbg to be able
#               to produce meaningful backtraces from the core file.
#
#               By default core files will be written to /tmp (can be 
#               changed by setting AST_DUMPCORE_DIR). Alternatively, see 
#               CORE_PATTERN below.
#AST_DUMPCORE=yes
#
# AST_DUMPCORE_DIR: By default asterisk runs in the directory '/' like any 
#               daemon. Setting this allows you to tell it to tell the 
#               Asterisk daemon to run in a different directory if 
#               AST_DUMPCORE is enabled. The default is
#               /var/spool/asterisk. That is a good choice because it
#               is writable (thus enabling the actual writing of the
#               core file) but relatively immune to symlink attacks
#               (because not world-writable like /tmp/).
#               Note, however, that if CORE_PATTERN is an absolute
#               path, it will override AST_DUMPCORE_DIR.
#
# CORE_PATTERN: If you use AST_DUMPCORE above, this is optionally set to a 
#               pattern of the core file. The default is not to touch the 
#               core_pattern settings, which is generally a good idea as 
#               it affects every core file generated on your system.
#
#               However if you just enable generation of core files and run 
#               asterisk as a daemon it will fail to write core files.
#
#               Alternatively you can set this independently elsewhere.
#               See http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt
#               Here is what Asterisk's ast_grab_core
#               script would expect:
#CORE_PATTERN='core.%p'
#               But you might prefer something like:
#CORE_PATTERN='core.%e.%t'
